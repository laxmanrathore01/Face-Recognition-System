# Face-Recognition-System
Face recognition technology has gained significant traction across various domains, including social
media, security, and surveillance. With advancements in machine learning and computer vision, facial
recognition has emerged as a reliable tool for automating tasks that traditionally required manual
intervention. Our project, SmartFace Attendance, leverages this technology to develop an intelligent
and efficient attendance management system.The proposed system utilizes Python and OpenCV to
implement real-time face recognition. By integrating the powerful Face Recognition module, a native
Python feature, our system ensures high accuracy and robustness. The system captures live video feeds
or images, processes facial features, and matches them against a stored database to verify identities.
Once authenticated, attendance records are automatically updated in a database, eliminating the need
for traditional roll calls or biometric methods.
Our system is designed to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, catering to educational institutions,
corporate offices, and other organizations requiring reliable attendance tracking. Key features include
real-time attendance marking, automated record maintenance, and instant reporting capabilities.
Additionally, the use of OpenCV for image processing enhances the systemâ€™s efficiency, ensuring
quick detection and recognition of faces under different lighting conditions and angles.
